# What
Basically this turns a Google Drive folder (currently `IT/files`) into a website, where each file in the drive folder is publicly accessible. We're currently trying this out as an alternative to Imgur. Once we've decided that this is working well, we'll make it the official recommendation and may move the `files` drive link to a more accessible location.

# Why
Our website generator uses data from a spreadsheet to build the site, including links to images we want to use on the site. For now, the generator needs those images need to be publicly accessible.
